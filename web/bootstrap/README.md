# Git repository containing pre-built bootstrap.

Saves me needing to download it all the time to use, I can just use a git submodule instead...

Not all releases will be here, only those I need/use.

No source will be included here, for source check [https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap] or [http://getbootstrap.com/]

Also included for convenience is a compatible version of jquery from around the time of the release.
